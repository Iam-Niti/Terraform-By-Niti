# Introduction
<br>
Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp that allows you to define, manage, and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. It is widely used to automate cloud resources across providers like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and even on-premise environments.
