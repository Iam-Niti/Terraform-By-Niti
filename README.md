# Introduction
Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp that allows you to define, manage, and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. It is widely used to automate cloud resources across providers like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and even on-premise environments.
<br>
# Why Terraform
1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) – Define infrastructure in code for consistency and automation.

2. Declarative Configuration – State what you want, and Terraform makes it happen.

3. Multi-Cloud Support – Works with AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, and more.

4. State Management – Keeps track of infrastructure using a state file.

5. Plan & Apply Workflow – Preview changes before applying them.

6. Modular & Reusable – Use modules for efficient infrastructure management.

Terraform operates in a simple workflow:

* Write – Define resources in .tf files.
* Plan – Preview changes before applying (terraform plan).
* Apply – Deploy resources (terraform apply).
* Destroy – Remove resources (terraform destroy).
